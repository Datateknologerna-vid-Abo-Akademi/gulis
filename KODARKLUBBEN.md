# Kodarklubben is something new, just for you!

kodarklubben will be for everyone who likes to code or wants to learn more but don't know what to do or dont want to sit at home doing it alone.

We are aiming to have weekly sessions.

Kodarklubben will try to have something to do for everyone,  
from [easy examples](https://github.com/Datateknologerna-vid-Abo-Akademi/gulis-python-exercise/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md) to [more challanging]() projects.


### why should you join us ?
Many easy examples (even our examples) can be found online but...  
* What if you get stuck and don't know how to continue?  
* What if you want to brag how good your code is ?  
* What if you don't want to code but want to do homework?

Don't worry, you are all welcome to our sessions and we will help you with your questions.
