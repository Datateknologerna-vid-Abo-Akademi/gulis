## JetBrains

[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) is a company that has an IDE for almost every language. If there isn't a dedicated IDE for something, there probably exists a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

### What is an IDE?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment):

```text
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
```

Some examples of IDEs are **IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains**, **Code::Blocks** and **Microsoft Visual Studio**

If you want to make things hard for you, feel free to use Eclipse. However, we recommend using IDEs by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com). This section will help you accuire the PRO versions for free and get them set up.

### Get the student licence

The student licence is automatically activated by your @abo.fi email and needs to be re-verified annually.

1. Start by visiting the [JetBrains student page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

### Get the JetBrains Toolbox App

The easiest way to download and update your JetBrains software, is with their Toolbox App.

* [Download JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/)

When the Toolbox App is installed, sign in with your JetBrains account.

### Download some IDEs

The tools that you need in the beginning are:

1. **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**. This is mostly for Java development, but plugins can make it do everything you can imagine.
2. **PyCharm Professional**. This will help you when developing Python.

We recommend choosing the Ultimate or Professional versions of these applications, as they have more features and, well, you can.

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is one of the few Microsoft products that actually work. Currently it is the most popular text editor among developers (according to Stack Overflow).

This text editor too depends on extensions to add features and of course, Git is built-in.

* [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

Similar editors are [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

## Git

### What is Git
From [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com):

```text
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
```

### Why you need it

We recommend setting up Git as early as possible, as it will come very handy during many courses, isn't really taught in school and knowing how to use it is expected by all employers.

### Next steps

As Git and Github are rather wide subjects, we have a dedicated guid for using them.
