# Things to know AFK (away from keyboard)

// TODO: add relevant stuff like FRANK, study grant and more?

## Before school starts

Bring something to write on (in addition to your computer), a few pens/pencils and a rubber.

## First weeks of school

A great place to spend time between lectures is our student associations office. Meet new people, drink a cup of coffee or have a coke (or beer).

We recommend you to attend events to make friends for life already the first few weeks.

Don't be afraid to ask for help, everyone has been in your shoes!  
[Telegram](COMMUNICATION.md#telegram) is a great place to ask for help.
