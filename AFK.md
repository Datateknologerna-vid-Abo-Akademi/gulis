## Before school start

Bring something to write on(in addition to your computer), a few pens and a rubber.


## First weeks of school

A great place to spend time between lectures is our student associations office. Meet new people, drink a cup of coffee or have a coke.  
We recommend you to attend events to make friends for life already the first few weeks.

Don't be afraid to ask for help, everyone has been in your shoes!
