# Communication inside DaTe

This will help you stay in touch with other students.

## Telegram

We use Telegram in DaTe for random communication. Telegram is superior to WhatsApp because:

* It is not owned by Facebook
* You can contact people by their usernames, no numbers required
* We have bots
* You can send stickers

Telegram is available on most platforms.

* [Browser version of Telegram](https://web.telegram.org)

## Slack

DaTe uses [Slack](https://slack.com) too.

Slack is a cloud-based set of proprietary team collaboration
tools and services, founded by Stewart Butterfield.
The name is an acronym for "Searchable Log of All
Conversation and Knowledge".
```

Slack is, like Telegram, available on most platforms.

Slack can also be accessed via your browser.

## Discord

designed for gaming communities. Discord runs on
Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in a web browser.
